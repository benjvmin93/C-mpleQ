# C-mpleQ

This project aims to emulate a quantum computer as a state vector emulation using C language.
It aims to be as efficient as possible in terms of memory management and computing speed.

It groups some knowledge I have learnt so far during my studies at EPITA (C programming / Quantum technologies) and that makes it very enjoyable for me to implement.
